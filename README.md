# **Cancer Diagnostic App**

## **Overview**
The **Cancer Diagnostic App** is a cutting-edge solution designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in diagnosing cancer and recommending appropriate treatments and medications. By leveraging a series of intelligently designed questions, the app takes user inputs and evaluates them against established medical guidelines to provide precise diagnostic and treatment suggestions. 

Currently, the app focuses on **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**, one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers. In the future, we plan to expand the app's capabilities to include other frequently detected cancers in humans, making it a versatile tool for cancer diagnostics.

## **Features**
- **Question-Based Diagnostics**: The app uses a series of questions extracted from **NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines** to gather detailed patient data.
- **Accurate Diagnosis**: Based on user inputs, the app identifies the specific cancer stage and characteristics.
- **Personalized Treatment Plans**:
  - Provides recommendations for treatment options, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other systemic therapies.
  - Suggests follow-up care and surveillance schedules for post-treatment management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive design ensures ease of use for both medical professionals and patients.
- **Scalability**: While it currently focuses on NSCLC, the app's framework is designed for easy integration of other cancer types in the future.

## **How It Works**
1. **Input Collection**:
   - The app asks a series of questions related to the patient’s clinical history, imaging results, and pathological findings.
   - Questions are categorized and structured according to the **NCCN guidelines** for NSCLC.
2. **Processing**:
   - User responses are processed using built-in logic derived from NCCN protocols to determine the stage and type of cancer.
3. **Output**:
   - Based on the analysis, the app provides:
     - Cancer stage and type.
     - Recommended treatments (e.g., surgical, systemic, or radiotherapy).
     - Medications or systemic therapies.
     - Follow-up or surveillance schedules.
4. **Future Expansion**:
   - Support for additional cancers will follow the same rigorous process using established medical guidelines.

## **Key Highlights**
- **Evidence-Based**: All questions and diagnostic logic are aligned with the latest **NCCN guidelines**, ensuring the app’s medical accuracy and reliability.
- **Adaptable for Future Cancers**: The modular structure allows easy addition of cancers such as breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer in upcoming updates.
- **Empowering Healthcare Professionals**: The app acts as a decision support tool for doctors, making it easier to diagnose and treat complex cancer cases.

## **Roadmap**
1. **Current Focus**: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
2. **Upcoming Features**:
   - Integration of diagnostic modules for other cancers, including:
     - Breast Cancer.
     - Colorectal Cancer.
     - Prostate Cancer.
     - Skin Cancer (Melanoma).
   - Enhanced support for follow-up care and survivorship programs.
   - AI-driven insights for improved diagnostics and treatment recommendations.
